# UniCompanion

# Description
A collaborative project to create web application that universities can give to their students. It would allow the students to sign up to any sports teams and societies they wish and have access to a calendar - this calendar displays the events for their selected teams and societies.
If you are a sports captain or society leader, you also have admin access and can add, update and remove events from the calendar.
